# About this project

I've worked on this small project to pratice some react concepts like immutability, this project was made with typescript.  
With this small to do app, we are able to create new tasks, mark as done and delete them.  

Each task is created with unique id using react-id-generator library.

To test if every function it's working, I've used jest framework.
